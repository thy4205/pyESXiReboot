# pyESXiReboot
Here is a python script to reboot an array of machines via the ESXi's Develeopper API. This also uses the VMTools functionality so it should be a more effiecent alternative than using batch shutdown command in Windows.

The script is entirly generated by OpenAI and modified slightly to suit my needs.
